# OlentangyFRC_Vision_2021
Our FRC robotics team embarked on a groundbreaking project during the 2021 season to enhance our robot's navigation and positioning capabilities through advanced computer vision techniques. Leveraging the power of OpenCV and PyTorch, we developed a custom computer vision pipeline to detect reflective tape strategically placed around the competition field.

The core of our project involved training a machine learning model using PyTorch to recognize and classify reflective tape. Through extensive data collection and training iterations, we fine-tuned our model to achieve high accuracy in detecting the reflective tape under various lighting conditions and angles.

Once the reflective tape was detected, we employed solve-PNP algorithms to determine the robot's position and orientation relative to the tape. This enabled us to achieve full field localization, allowing our robot to precisely navigate the competition field and execute complex maneuvers with precision and efficiency.
